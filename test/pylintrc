[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disabling messages that we either don't care about
# for tests or are necessary to break for tests.
#
# C0103 : invalid-name (we prefer long, descriptive, names for tests)
# C0111 : missing-docstring (we don't write docstrings for tests)
# C0330 : bad-continuation (we let black handle this)
# C0412 : ungrouped-imports (we let isort handle this)
# E1101 : no-member (raised on patched objects with mock checks)
# R0205 : useless-object-inheritance (we need to support Python 2, so no, not useless)
# R0801 : duplicate`-code (unit tests for similar things tend to be similar)
# R0914 : too-many-locals (we prefer clarity over brevity in tests)
# R0903 : too-few-public-methods (common for stub classes sometimes needed in tests)
# W0212 : protected-access (raised when calling _ methods)
# W0621 : redefined-outer-name (raised when using pytest-mock)
# W0613 : unused-argument (raised when patches are needed but not called)
