4.1.0 -- 2021-10-11
===================

Deprecation
-----------
The AWS Encryption SDK CLI no longer supports Python 3.5
as of major version 4.1.x; only Python 3.6+ is supported. Customers using
Python 3.5 can still use the 3.x line of the AWS Encryption SDK CLI,
which will continue to receive security updates until 2022-07-13, in accordance
with our `Support Policy <https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-cli/blob/master/SUPPORT_POLICY.rst>`__.

Maintenance
-----------
* Python 3.10 testing and support


4.0.0 -- 2021-07-13
===================

Deprecation
-----------
The AWS Encryption SDK CLI no longer supports Python 2 or Python 3.4
as of major version 4.x; only Python 3.5+ is supported. Customers using Python 2
or Python 3.4 can still use the 3.x line of the AWS Encryption SDK CLI,
which will continue to receive security updates for the next 12 months, in accordance
with our `Support Policy <https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-cli/blob/master/SUPPORT_POLICY.rst>`__.


3.1.0 -- 2021-07-13
===================

Deprecation Announcement
------------------------
The AWS Encryption SDK CLI is discontinuing support for Python 2. Future major versions
of this library will drop support for Python 2 and begin to adopt changes that are known
to break Python 2.

Support for Python 3.4 will be removed at the same time. Moving forward, we will support
Python 3.5+.

Security updates will still be available for the AWS Encryption SDK CLI 3.x line for
the next 12 months, in accordance with our `Support Policy <https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-cli/blob/master/SUPPORT_POLICY.rst>`__.


3.0.0 -- 2021-06-16
===================

Features
--------
* AWS KMS multi-Region Key support

  CLI now supports Multi-Region Keys (MRKs).
  Usage of MRKs is identical to the usage of non-MRK KMS Keys.
  Though a KMS Key does not have to be a MRK key for it to be used.

  See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html
  for more details about AWS KMS multi-Region Keys.

  See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/configure.html#config-mrks
  for more details about how the AWS Encryption SDK interoperates
  with AWS KMS multi-Region keys.

2.2.0 -- 2021-05-27
===================

Features
--------
* Improvements to the message decryption process

  See https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-cli/security/advisories/GHSA-89v2-g37m-g3ff.

2.1.0 -- 2020-10-27
===================

Bugfixes
--------
* Fix for enabling or disabling discovery mode in the CLI

Breaking Changes
----------------
* The ``--discovery`` parameter is removed. It is replaced by a ``discovery`` attribute of the
  ``--wrapping-keys`` parameter.

2.0.0 -- 2020-09-24
===================

New Features
------------

* Updates to the AWS Encryption SDK. 2542b58

  This change includes fixes for issues that were reported by Thai Duong from Google's Security
  team, and for issues that were identified by AWS Cryptography.

  BREAKING CHANGE: AWS KMS KeyIDs must be specified explicitly or Discovery mode explicitly chosen.

  Key committing suites are now default. CommitmentPolicy requires commitment by default.
